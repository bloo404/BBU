C functions

call function -> (jumps) goes to a function and then returns back to the next function

arguments are placed from right to left

result is returned in eax

save eax,ecx,eds before the call function

pushad -> push all registers on the stack
(call...)
popad -> pops all their values back (we could store the result from the call from eax somewhere outisde registers before giving them back their values)

ASM

	printf(")..%d..%d..",n,m);
		|
		v
	n dd 10
	m dd 5
	format db "I have %d apples and %d airplanes", 0
	
	push dword [m] (reverse order from C (right to left))
	push dword [n]
	push format
	call [printf]	; adds to the stack m,n,format,return
			; then pops the return address, but not the rest
	add esp, 4*3	; empties the stack
	
	
Decreasing stack: we go down in the stack
- the addresses start from the end [f] [n] [m]
				 44  46  50  54
Increasing stack: we go up the stack


push dword n <=> &n in C
call [scanf] to read

scanf -> double word, overrides the first charachters if it was not declared as a double in the first place

fopen => file descriptor (open)
fprintf => write in a file
fread => reads buffers from a file
fclose => close a file

also have to include

extern exit,printf,scanf ; what we called
import exit msvcrt.dll	; where is it imported from
import printf msvcrt.dll
import scanf msvcrt.dll
