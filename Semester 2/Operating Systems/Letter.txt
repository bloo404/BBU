Hello, dear reader.

I must tell you...these 10h have been intense and OS is the parent
of the ASC volume you did in the first semester of the 1st year in
CS uni.

It s been tough and a lot going on and CS itself it s a field
that requires a lot of technicality and social life starts to lose
meaning because you don t have as much time for it anymore.

I do love tech and this field a lot, and the math inside.
My grades might not reflect too well my passion, but all I know
is if you have a spark, you need to kerosene it.

My message to you is that, "Show must go on", whatever happens.

Best wishes for you,
        and many restless days and nights,
                to a future for science,
                        Blu
